# Frontend Project

This repository contains the frontend code that supports the backend project. The frontend was pre-existing and used as a companion to the backend developed in a tutorial by [Devtiro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iJ0NWRaWic).

---

## Features

- User interface for interacting with the backend API.
- CRUD operations for managing authors and books.
- Pre-built functionality to test the integration with the backend.

---

## Context

The frontend was not the focus of the tutorial or my development process. It was used primarily to support the backend and demonstrate the integration between the two layers. Minimal modifications were made to ensure compatibility with the backend.
